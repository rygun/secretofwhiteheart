# secretofwhiteheart
goossh.. I didn't expect someone to open this link, hahaha anyway I know you got here because you saw my public account, and yes that's right this will explain about WHITE LOVE
which is an emoticon that I only give to people who really mean something to me, can't be explained in words, but the point is I will give a white heart to someone who is really the reason I am happy, enthusiastic, grateful, feel loved in this world, the true meaning of life
and funfact this white heart emoticon I have never used, typed, issued, even commented using it, because yes back again it can only be used once to humans

so if you get it means you are the NO.1 person and it sounds ridiculous alay right?, but this is the truth, by the way this white heart from birth I like it why?
.
you know I love white color, and white love? well its special for me, even to my family there has never been a white heart.
even my mother
